# ALBUMS-WS is the Spring application Name rather than using Server:port becuase the port is assigned dynamically everytime the Microservice starts
# Also, when the Http Client RestTempale sees ALBUMS-WS it will ask Eureka for all the address for ALBUMS-WS Microservice to balance the load 
# This property is not used as RestTempale was replaced by Feign service client
